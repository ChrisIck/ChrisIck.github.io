This is a paper demonstrating using Gaussian processes to characterize quasi-periodic solar flare oscillations via kernel parameter estimation. I developed this project during my work after completing my bachelors before starting my masters at NYU CDS. [Read it on arxiv.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12716)
